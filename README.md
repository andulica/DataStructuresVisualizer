# DataStructViz


DataStructViz is a web application to visualise data-structure operations (e.g., insertion, deletion, searching) with interactive, step-by-step animations, aimed at students and educators to simplify complex algorithmic concepts.

## üöÄ Features

- Visualize operations such as insertion, deletion, searching in various data structures. Also the code displayed highlights the current line for the given step in the algorithm giving you the best experience for better understanding what is happening behind the scene.

- Give our interactive quiz a shot and see how well you really know your data structures, then snag custom feedback based on your answers. You can even chat with our integrated bot about anything under the tech sun‚Äîjust don‚Äôt ask for recipe tips, because it hasn't quite made its MasterChef debut... yet!

- Adding and editing quiz topics, questions, and answers has never been easier‚Äîassuming you have admin privileges, of course!

## üöß Future features 

- I‚Äôm on track with implementing a user quiz scoring system. So far, I‚Äôve set up authentication and authorization using the Identity library and JWT (JSON Web Tokens), which I need for the Admin role to manage quiz data.
- By March I plan to add a few hundreds of questions and a system to randomise questions in quizzes.
- Since this is still an MVP, I'll also improve the front end by using libraries like Bootstrap. Sure, I'm no Picasso or Einstein, but hey‚Äîfull-stack engineering is trending, so let‚Äôs juggle brushstrokes and breakpoints like pros!
- Also, I'll do my best to implement a caching system‚Äîor at least pagination‚Äîfor quizzes. Querying the database can take a while‚Ä¶ I know.

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

You can download the zip file from this repository and just run it on visual studio. Be careful to run BlazorAppForDataStructures project because the solution consists of 2 projects, one is for the underlying logic of data structures and the other one is a Blazor project, the one that you actually want to run. 
- Also the app makes calls to OpenAI API for custom feedback at the end of the quiz and the API key is securely stored on the Azure Web Service Instance so you won't be able to access it. If you prefer you can put your own API key there and make use of the feature.
- Another point that is worth mentioning is the fact that the app uses an internal CRUD API for managing quiz related businesses and also the login and register sections. The API is up and running but there is a hashing key stored securely on the API server and is not accessible making the previously mentioned features unusable. You can still make your own quizzes by updating the latest migration and add questions manually from SQL tool such as Azure SQL Studio.
