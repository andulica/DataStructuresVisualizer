# DataStructViz


DataStructViz is a web application to visualise data-structure operations (e.g., insertion, deletion, searching) with interactive, step-by-step animations, aimed at students and educators to simplify complex algorithmic concepts.

## üöÄ Features

- Visualize operations such as insertion, deletion, searching in various data structures. Also the code displayed highlights the current line for the given step in the algorithm giving you the best experience for better understanding what is happening behind the scene.

- Give our interactive quiz a shot and see how well you really know your data structures, then snag custom feedback based on your answers. You can even chat with our integrated bot about anything under the tech sun‚Äîjust don‚Äôt ask for recipe tips, because it hasn't quite made its MasterChef debut... yet!

- Adding and editing quiz topics, questions and answers have never been easier! Of course, if you have Admin privilegies :) .

## üöß Future features 

- I‚Äôm on track with implementing a user quiz scoring system. So far, I‚Äôve set up authentication and authorization using the Identity framework and JWT (JSON Web Tokens), which I need for the Admin role to manage quiz data.
- By March I plan to add a few hundreds of questions and a system to randomise questions in quizzes.
- Since this is still an MVP, I'll also improve the front end by using libraries like Bootstrap. Sure, I'm no Picasso or Einstein, but hey‚Äîfull-stack engineering is trending, so let‚Äôs juggle brushstrokes and breakpoints like pros!
- Also, I'll do my best to implement a caching system‚Äîor at least pagination‚Äîfor quizzes. Querying the database can take a while‚Ä¶ I know.

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

You can download the zip file from this repository and just run it on visual studio. Be careful to run BlazorAppForDataStructures project because the solution consists of 2 projects, one is for the underlying logic of data structures and the other one is a Blazor project, the one that you actually want to run.

## ü§ù Contributing
DataStructViz does not stop here and I would love more people to get involved in the project. Whether you have ideas to share, bugs to report, or features to implement, your contributions are welcome!
